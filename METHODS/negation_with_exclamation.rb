#the exclamation mark is used in Ruby to negate sth e.g.
puts false
puts !false #when we put ! before false we're gonna get true - the opposite
#of false
puts !true
#the exclamation point will always give us the boolean value. Using it we can
#turn a number into a boolean value. The number itself represents true
# so if we put one ! we will get false and if we want to get the true
#we need to put ! twice:

p !! 23
p ! 23
p 23
